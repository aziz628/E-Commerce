# üì¶ E-commerce Project: Full Technical Summary

## ‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

This project started as a **raw Node.js e-commerce backend** built from scratch ‚Äî with plain HTTP server, manual routing, custom static file serving, basic token handling, and SQLite.

Over time, it evolved into a **modern Express + MySQL powered back-end**, with:

- **REST APIs** for user management, products, admin tools.
- **JWT authentication with refresh tokens.**
- **Role-based access** (user vs. admin).
- A real-time **notifications system** using WebSocket (and explored Socket.io conceptually).
- A **SharedWorker** architecture for multi-tab WS connection reuse.
- Front-end upgraded with **Bootstrap** and EJS templates for faster styling and dynamic rendering.
- Thoughtful folder structure: `routes/`, `controllers/`, `services/` (was `models`), `middlewares/`, `views/`, `public/`.

| Layer                         | Technology                              | Notes                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server**              | Node.js + Express                       | Switched from raw `http` server to Express for routing, middleware, scalability.                  |
| **Auth**                | JWT + Refresh Tokens                    | Secure cookies, token rotation, manual verify/reset logic.                                          |
| **Database**            | MySQL (with `mysql2/promise`)         | Switched from SQLite file DB to robust MySQL server with connection pooling.                        |
| **Real-time**           | Raw WebSocket + SharedWorker            | Implemented real-time push for notifications; used SharedWorker to share WS connection across tabs. |
| **Frontend Templating** | EJS                                     | Server-side rendering for admin dashboard, product lists.                                           |
| **Styling**             | Bootstrap                               | Rapid UI layout, consistent components for only admin panel                                         |
| **Client-side JS**      | Vanilla JS + modular scripts            | For dynamic UI, WS handling, admin actions.                                                         |
| **Dev Tools**           | Postman for testing,`.env` for config | Ready for future Swagger or full test coverage.                                                     |

## ‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Concepts Explored

### üîë Authentication

- Manual JWT generation + verification.
- Refresh token rotation on expiry.
- Secure, HttpOnly cookies with `SameSite` policy.
- Role check for admin vs. user.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Real-Time Notifications

- Used **WebSocket server** attached to the Express HTTP server.
- Handled connection upgrades from HTTP to WS (HTTP handshake ‚Üí Upgrade header).
- Stored live WS connections in a `Set`.
- Implemented custom message routing for different WS events (`notification:pull`, `notification:seen`).
- discussed **SharedWorker** to reuse single WS connection across browser tabs ‚Üí reduces redundant sockets for notifs if many pages opened.

### üóÇÔ∏è Clean Architecture

- Separated code by **MVC** pattern:
  - `routes/`: entry points and route grouping.
  - `controllers/`: business logic for each resource.
  - `services/` (renamed from `models`): raw DB queries.
  - `middlewares/`: auth checks, async handler, global error handler.
- Centralized `config/` for DB pool and secrets.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

- Switched to MySQL with connection pool.
- Implemented reset tokens, refresh tokens in separate tables.
- Notifications: many-to-many (`notifications` + `user_notifications`).
- Users: extended with `role`, `last_seen_id`.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Admin Panel (Prototype)

- Routes to add products, broadcast notifications, send targeted user notifications.
- Frontend form: Bootstrap-styled, uses EJS to render user list.
- Backend: Basic CRUD, role check middleware.

### üí° Miscellaneous

- Bootstrap for quick styling instead of Tailwind, due to time and simplicity.
- Used `dotenv` for config injection.
- Learned Postman collections for basic API testing.
- Learned practical rate-limiting approaches (in-memory ).

## ‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Current Limitations

- **Frontend**:

  - Some HTML pages still hardcoded (e.g. products on homepage).
  - Checkout page is static; no real payment/order processing yet.
  - Cart is localStorage only ‚Äî not synced with DB.
  - Notifications UI could be more dynamic.
- **Backend**:

  - No unit tests or automated API tests yet.
  - No OpenAPI/Swagger docs or .md API docs.
  - No production caching or scaling measures yet.
  - Error handling needs standardization in all DB services.
- **Admin**:

  - Only minimal add & notify actions.
  - No full CRUD for products or users.
  - No stats/graphs dashboard yet.

## ‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Improvement Steps

### üîπ Code & Architecture

- [ ] Refactor all DB queries to use proper services with robust error handling.
- [ ] Add validation layers (e.g. `joi` or `express-validator`).
- [ ] Add tests: unit tests for services, integration tests for routes (e.g. Supertest).

### üîπ API & Docs

- [ ] Create Postman collection or Swagger docs for the API.
- [ ] Add proper README with install/run instructions.

### üîπ Features

- [ ] Implement full CRUD for products.
- [ ] Implement orders table & checkout flow.
- [ ] Sync cart with backend (sessions or user-based).
- [ ] Extend admin: user management, sales stats, charts (use Chart.js).

### üîπ Frontend

- [ ] Replace static homepage products with dynamic DB content.
- [ ] Improve Bootstrap theme: custom colors, branding.
- [ ] Consider partial SSR from ejs  + CSR when needed for better UX.

### üîπ Real-Time

- [ ] Polish WebSocket system: auto reconnect, robust message protocol.
- [ ] Consider switching to Socket.io for rooms, reconnections, easier scaling.

### üîπ Performance & Deployment

- [ ] Add Redis caching for frequent reads.
- [ ] Use a production-ready server (e.g. PM2).
- [ ] Deploy with env config for DB, JWT secrets.
